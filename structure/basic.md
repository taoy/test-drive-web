Entry Structure
---------------

### Categories

All entries should filed into these 6 categories (An entry maybe filed into
several categories).

- People
- Places
- Things (Books / Music / Movies / Gadgets)
- Events (History)
- Technology
- Idea (Thoughts)

### Tags
Each entries can have some tags. Each tag can filed into above categories.

### Collections

Just like Google+'s Collection.


Keyword and links
-----------------

In a post, if there are keywords ([keyword]), it should link to correspond
post, even if that post doesn't exist.

The correspond post is the definition (for me) post and should have some linkes
to public resources (e.g. for movie, IMDB).
