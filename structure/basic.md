Basic structure
===============

- diary
- blog
- keywords and definitions

Each entry has 4 items:
- Title
- Summary
- Post (Content)
- Date / Time (posted date/time)

Internally another date/time record:
- Publish date

Entry Structure
---------------

All entries should filed into these 6 categories (An entry maybe filed into
several categories).

- People
- Places
- Things (Books / Music / Movies / Gadgets)
- Events (History)
- Technology
- Idea (Thoughts)

Each entries can have some tags. Each tag can filed into above categories.

Keyword and links
-----------------

In a post, if there are keywords ([keyword]), it should link to correspond
post, even if that post doesn't exist.

The correspond post is the definition (for me) post and should have some linkes
to public resources (e.g. for movie, IMDB).
